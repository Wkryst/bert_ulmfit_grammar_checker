# Grammar checker using BERT and ULMFIT.



**Input:** sentence.

**Output:** if it is grammatically correct or not(using both BERT and ULMFIT).

Here the models are trained on Google-colab and after training the classifiers are downloaded and further used for grammar checking. 

We'll use The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset for single sentence classification. It's a set of sentences labeled as grammatically correct or incorrect. It was first published in May of 2018, and is one of the tests included in the "GLUE Benchmark" on which models like BERT are competing.
